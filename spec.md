# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebuild and redeploy the full Rweb Infotech laptop selling & services website (frontend + backend) so all pages load correctly in production with a warm orange/amber visual theme and all static assets properly referenced.

**Planned changes:**
- Rebuild and redeploy the entire application (frontend + backend) to run in production without errors
- Ensure all pages load correctly: Home, Products, Brands, Laptop Detail, About Us, Contact, and Chat
- Apply a consistent warm orange/amber color palette across all pages with hover effects, active states, and smooth transitions
- Implement a site header with Rweb Infotech logo, search bar, navigation links, and working mobile menu
- Implement a site footer with About Us text, Google Maps location link, CEO name, and contact phone number
- Ensure all static images (logo, hero banner, brand placeholders, laptop product images, chat avatar) are present under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and correctly referenced throughout the UI with no broken image links

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse the fully functional Rweb Infotech website — exploring laptop products, filtering by brand, viewing detailed product pages, reading about the company, contacting via the footer, and chatting with the AI assistant — all with a cohesive warm orange/amber design on desktop and mobile.
