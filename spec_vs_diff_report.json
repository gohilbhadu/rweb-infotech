  "summary": "The diff implements a substantial rebuild of the Rweb Infotech frontend and backend. Most REQ-31, REQ-32, and REQ-33 requirements appear addressed, but there are notable gaps around generated static image files, the logo rendering in the header (uses a Lucide icon instead of the generated PNG), and specific named image files required by the spec.",

      "requirement": "Rweb Infotech logo image (rweb-logo.dim_200x60.png) must be present under frontend/public/assets/generated and rendered in the site header.",
      "reason": "The SiteHeader.tsx uses a Lucide Laptop icon and text wordmark instead of the generated logo PNG (rweb-logo.dim_200x60.png). No evidence the file exists or is referenced in the header.",

      "reason": "No HomePage file appears in the diff, and no reference to hero-banner.dim_1200x400.png is visible in any modified file. The hero section CSS class hero-gradient is defined but uses a CSS gradient, not the required static image.",
